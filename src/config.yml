# Sadly there is no nice way to have friendly names. As such,
#  the material values are used. For instance, two of the tool
#  bindings are scroll tool to bone, which is 352, and the
#  duplicator tool is the stone axe, or 275.
# 
# Individual tool configuration option descriptions are found
#  in the help/<tool>.txt files. Those files will always have
#  the most up-to-date default settings for each tool.
# 
# debug: <true|false>
#    Don't enable this unless you want a bunch of data dumped
#    to the console logs. Can be useful for validating your
#    config.yml file, as it dumps what it reads.
# 
# permissions: <true|false>
#    While permissions are very handy and often the best way
#    to control the use of tools, some people do not like them.
#    If that is the case, set this to false to disable
#    permission checking.
# 
# useEvent: <true|false>
#    If you have a region restricting plugin like WorldGuard
#    or a logging plugin like LogBlock, having this enabled
#    should follow the region restrictions, and log changes.
#    If you don't care about such protection, you should be
#    able to disable this. If you find a plugin that does
#    not integrate with this option, please open an issue at:
#    https://github.com/Peter200lx/ToolBelt/issues
# 
# tools: bind: <tool>: <id>
#    This gives a mapping of what item to use for what tool.
#    If a tool is not wanted, you can disable it by removing
#    the permission from the (or all) user(s). If you want to
#    run the server without permissions, it is suggested to
#    remove it by adding a '#' to the beginning of the line.
#    However, setting it's value to zero will also disable
#    the tool, it but with a warning to the console.
# 
# tools: global: <list type>:
#    Any list in the tools.global section only applies to tools
#    that have a list of the same name. If the tool specific
#    version of the list is [], then the global list takes
#    precedence.
# 
# tools: global: onlyAllow:  <[]|[ <id>, ...]>
#    If you want to very explicitly limit which materials can be
#    copied into tools, and what types of materials can be
#    overwritten, specify those blocks here. By default this
#    list is empty, which means that all materials not blocked
#    in the next two lists are allowed. NOTE: this list does not
#    overwrite the two block lists below, it simply further
#    restricts the use of tools. Example, onlyAllow: [3,35]
#    stopCopy: [7], stopOverwrite: [7,35] means that the player
#    can copy dirt or wool with any tool, but only overwrite
#    dirt blocks. They can't load/overwrite bedrock both because
#    it is not in onlyAllow and because it's blocked in the stop*
#    lists
# 
# tools: global: stopCopy:  [ <id>, ...]
#    Item IDs set in here will not copy into a tool. Some
#    of the items can be safely re-enabled (46 is TNT) while
#    others have the possibility of an odd map state (75 is the
#    REDSTONE_TORCH_OFF which is an unnatural state for a Redstone
#    torch that's not being powered). Open an issue on GitHub if
#    enabling any of these breaks the game (or if I missed any).
# 
# tools: global: stopOverwrite:  [ <id>, ...]
#    Item IDs set in here will not be overwritten when the user
#    paints. Other then that the message is the same as for
#    the above stopCopy
# 
# tools: global: repeatDelay: <# of milliseconds>
#    Clicking on grass and such breaks through and throws another
#    event for the the block behind it. To prevent such issues,
#    and for rate limiting the usage of dangerous tools, you can
#    set this value. 125 = 1/8 sec, 250 = 1/4 sec, 1000 = 1 sec,
#    0 = no delay. The repeatDelay option can be used on individual
#    tools, but that is more advanced. Summary for tool specific
#    use: -1 = use global value, 0 = no delay, positive # = delay
#    amount.
